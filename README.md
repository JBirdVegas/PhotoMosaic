# PhotoMosaic

Creates a photo mosaic for a given target image from a collection of images.

TODO:
- [x] make it basically work
- [ ] use args4j to collect command line arguments
- [ ] tidy up / refactor
- [ ] support reading images for collection recursivly from given directory
- [ ] introduce different strategies for placing the tiles
- [ ] use multiple threads

## My first result
Used a tile size of 40x30 pixels. The provided image collection was quite poor but I like it anyway :)
